# Enterprise Generative AI Financial Architecture

Reference architecture, technical diagrams, and implementation artifacts for designing enterprise-grade Generative AI systems in regulated financial environments.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a practical, implementation-oriented reference for building secure, scalable, and compliant Generative AI platforms in financial services and other regulated industries.

The materials reflect architectural patterns and technical considerations commonly encountered when moving Generative AI systems from prototype to production, including governance, auditability, operational resilience, and integration into enterprise ecosystems.
