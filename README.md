# Enterprise Generative AI Financial Architecture

Reference architecture, technical diagrams, and implementation artifacts for designing enterprise-grade Generative AI systems in regulated financial environments.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a practical, implementation-oriented reference for building secure, scalable, and compliant Generative AI platforms in financial services and other regulated industries.

The materials reflect architectural patterns and technical considerations commonly encountered when moving Generative AI systems from prototype to production, including governance, auditability, operational resilience, and integration into enterprise ecosystems.

---

## Scope of the Repository

This project includes:

- Architecture blueprints for enterprise-scale AI platforms  
- Reference implementations for governance and auditability  
- Technical artifacts demonstrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
- API-based service orchestration examples  
- Documentation describing production constraints in regulated environments  
- Design patterns for scalability, security, and operational reliability  

---

## Architecture Artifacts

Located in:
/docs/architecture/
/diagrams_source/


Includes:

- High-level enterprise GenAI platform architecture  
- Governance and compliance architecture  
- Data flow and integration architecture  
- Component interaction diagrams  
- Deployment topology examples

## Implementation Artifacts
/src/

Includes example components such as:

- RAG pipeline examples  
- Governance enforcement logic  
- Audit logging mechanisms  
- API orchestration patterns  
- Policy enforcement examples  
- Prompt lifecycle management patterns  

These components are **illustrative technical artifacts** intended to demonstrate architectural patterns rather than production-ready code.

## Key Technical Themes

This repository focuses on real-world engineering considerations such as:

- Secure LLM integration in enterprise environments  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) design patterns  
- Governance controls (model usage, access control, policy enforcement)  
- Auditability and traceability of AI decisions  
- Data privacy and protection in regulated systems  
- Hybrid deployment patterns (cloud + on-prem constraints)  
- System reliability, observability, and operational monitoring  

---

## Intended Audience

This material is relevant to:

- Software Architects  
- Senior Engineers  
- Platform Engineers  
- AI/ML Engineers  
- Engineering Managers  
- Technical Leaders building AI systems in regulated environments
